This app displays the selling duration for 6,631 sold houses in the cities of Eindhoven, Maastricht, Leeuwarden and Dordrecht. Users have the possibility to switch between cities, insert the construction year and the price. This app is perfect for house sellers to gain insights in how long houses in a certain city, with a certain construction year and for a certain price are for sale. For example, houses build between 2005-2022 in Eindhoven, for a price between 247.500 and 327.500 are usually sold within 50 days. 

The app also illustrates the results as found in our linear regression. Especially in Eindhoven it's clear to see that the higher the price, the longer the sellingduration.
